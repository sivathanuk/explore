- How to use a function to manipulate storage variables
- Reading a mapping
- Use a function to read a variable
- Use a function to read a value in a mapping, where the slot you read is the value from the first call
- Use a function to show you know the correct value of the value in the mapping
- Public/private variables
- Use a function to get assigned a private variable
- Use a function to duplicate this variable in a public variable
- Use a function to show you know the correct value of the private variable
- External vs internal functions
- Use a function to get assigned a private variable
- Use an internal function to duplicate this variable in a public variable
- Use a function to show you know the correct value of the private variable
- Understanding functions to compare values
- Recursions - basics
- Checking that the array is at least of length x
- Calculating the sum of the array sent by the user
- Internal functions
- function used to find sum recursively
- Composability
	- Use this contract to retrieve the address of contract ex10b.cairo, which holds the key to this exercise
- Temporary functions
- Importing functions
- Read this contract and understand how it imports functions from another contract
- Find the relevant contract it imports from
- Events
- Use a function to get assigned a private variable
- Use a function to emit event with the value of the private variable
- Emit an event with secret value
- Privacy
- Use past data from transactions sent to the contract to find a value that is supposed to be "secret"
- Deploy a contract that validates various exercises in a single transaction
- Calling caller's validate_various_exercises() function
- Retrieving ERC20 address
- Reading contract balance before calling
- Verifying that caller collected some points
- Read how many points were collected
- Check that at least x points were collected
